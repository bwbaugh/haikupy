HaikuPy
=======

An English language haiku generator that uses the 5-7-5 syllable pattern.

Type of Haiku
-------------

We use the term haiku loosely, as we use the 5-7-5 pattern for syllables and not *mora*. In addition, we do not consider *kireji* ("cutting word"), *kigo* (season word), objective imagery or other literary haiku standards.

For more information, see one of many good resources on the subject, the [American Haiku Archives](http://www.americanhaikuarchives.org/faq.html).
